        The Universal Standard Products and Services Classification (UNSPSC) is
        a widely used classification system that is designed to help
        organizations identify and categorize the products and services that
        they use. The system was developed by the United Nations Development
        Programme (UNDP) and is managed by GS1 US, a not-for-profit organization
        that specializes in global supply chain standards.
        <br />
        UNSPSC codes are a four-level hierarchical coding structure that
        provides a standard way of classifying products and services across a
        wide range of industries. The codes are based on a system of numerical
        digits and are used to identify and categorize goods and services by
        their common characteristics. The first two digits of an UNSPSC code
        indicate the main category or family of products, while the remaining
        digits provide further detail about the product or service.
        <br />
        The latest version of the UNSPSC code system is version 25.0901, which
        was released in February 2023. This version includes a number of updates
        and improvements over previous versions, including new codes for
        emerging technologies and services, as well as updated descriptions and
        specifications for existing codes.
        <br />
        One of the key features of the latest version of the UNSPSC code system
        is the addition of new codes for digital products and services. These
        codes are designed to help organizations better classify and manage
        digital assets such as software, data, and online services. The new
        codes include categories such as digital content creation, digital
        marketing, and digital infrastructure, among others.
        <br />
        Another significant update in the latest version of the UNSPSC code
        system is the addition of new codes for sustainable and eco-friendly
        products and services. These codes are designed to help organizations
        identify and track sustainable products and services across their supply
        chain, and to promote more sustainable practices and products in
        general. The new codes include categories such as sustainable
        agriculture, renewable energy, and green transportation, among others.
